This software is being developed for fun and as a way for me to practice java and javafx. It is provided as is and while I have a list of planned features (listed below) I make no promise or commitment as to which of those will be implemented, when they will be released or that the software will remain available to download in the future.

If you use this app you take all responsibility to breach of terms of service or copyright that might be caused by downloading, using or redistributing images of Maqic cards.

Features complete:
- Load "Deck.txt"
- Read up to 70 unique cards from the deck file
- Combine card scans into a single image and save it as Deck.jpg

Features planned for next release:
- Save the deck as a .json file ready for use in Tabletop Simulator
- Allow the user to specify which file to load as decklist
- Allow the user to specify where to save the .jpg and .json files

Bugs to fix:
- Cards in sideboard are treated as unique even if they appear in the main deck
- Load the back of flip-able cards (currently front face loaded only)

Features planned for later releases:
- Complete gui showing the decklist as loaded
- Preview of the deck image
- Support for 70+ unique card decks
- Ability to chose different set from which to take images
- Multithreaded card and card image loading
- Ability to upload custom card images
- Ability to chose what card data is being saved in the .json file
- Custom card backs and card in hand graphic
